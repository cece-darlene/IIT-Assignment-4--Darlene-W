##The purpose of this program is to produce a shell based menu for the user to be able to add in new bank details 
    ##AND to be able to calculate the balance in their account after one year
        ##The calculation will be made using the amount deposited, interest rate of the bank and the compound of the bank
            ##The bankDetails.txt is a shared document between these two programs
